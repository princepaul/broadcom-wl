  # NOTE(antoineco): This job only tests that the module builds on whatever
  # kernel version the GitHub Actions runner is running:
  # https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/ubuntu20/20220425.1/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md
  #
  # Ideally, we would be able to select one runner for each kernel version we
  # intend to support, but this likely requires deploying self-hosted runners.
